IBLOpenBadges
=============

This is the XBlock (an extenstion component for the Open edX course platform) to allow awarding badges from an online course using Open edX. The XBlock was developed by IBL Studios, with conceptual and feature design by Lorena A. Barba and Michael Amigot, and used for Prof. Barba's course ["Practical Numerical Methods with Python."](http://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/GW/MAE6286/2014_fall/about)

_Note: For develop, remember to setup the badge with the variable debug_mode to 1,
this will activate the application debug mode. If debug mode is ON you'll be able to 
award the same badge any time for the same user. Under production stage, remember
to turn off the debug_mode variable._
